abstract: >-
  AMSLib provides the infrastructure to tightly couple
  multi-scale physics simulation code with ML surrogate
  model inference. It provides a wholistic runtime execution
  paradigm to support uncertainty quantification, surrogate
  model inference, persistent data storing throughout the
  execution of a simulation
