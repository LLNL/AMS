    The class provides a future abstraction for training jobs. In 'AMS' training jobs
    are actually a sequence of 2 jobs. First we do the sub-selection and right after
    we schedule a ml model training job. The future provides accessor to the description
    of the current AMS training job and the phase in which the job is part off.

    In addition to all of the ``flux.job.FluxExecutorFuture`` functionality,
    ``AMSFluxExecutorFuture`` instances offer:

    * The ``uri`` and ``add_uri_callback`` methods for retrieving the
      Flux uri of the instance executing this job. This is convenient for
      nested jobs

    Valid events are contained in the ``EVENTS`` class attribute.
